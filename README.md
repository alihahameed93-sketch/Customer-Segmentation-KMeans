## Objective
Group mall customers into segments based on Annual Income and
Spending Score to design targeted marketing strategies.

## Dataset
Mall Customers Dataset  
Features used: Annual Income (k$), Spending Score (1-100)

## Approach
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature selection and scaling
- K-Means clustering for segmentation
- PCA for visualization
- Designing marketing strategies for each segment

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Results
The customers were grouped into 5 distinct clusters. Each cluster
represents a different spending behavior and income level.
